Bugfix: Add support for Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) on windows

We've added support for Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) on windows.

Volume Shadow Copy Service allows read access to files that are locked by
another process using an exclusive lock. Restic was unable to backup those
files before. This update enabled backing up these files.
